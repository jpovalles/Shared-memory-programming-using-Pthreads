# Shared-memory-programming-using-Pthreads
This repository contains the source code for a hands-on workshop on multithreaded parallel programming using Pthreads. It includes implementations for estimating the value of Ï€ (Pi) using different methods:  
* Taylor Series Approximation (taylorpi.cpp)
* Monte Carlo Method with Threads (carlopi.cpp) 
* Monte Carlo Method without Threads (montepi.cpp)
